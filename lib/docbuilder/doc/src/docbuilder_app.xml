  <description>
    <p>DocBuilder provides functionality for generating HTML
       documentation for Erlang modules and Erlang/OTP applications
       from XML source code and/or EDoc comments in Erlang source code.
    </p>
  </description>

  <section>
    <title>Limitations</title>
    <p>DocBuilder is primarily intended for generating documentation
      for Erlang/OTP itself. That is, no attempt has been made to create
      a tool suitable for generating documentation in general.</p>
