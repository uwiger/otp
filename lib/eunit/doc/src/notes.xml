	    Increase depth of error messages in Eunit Surefire
	    reports</p>
          <p>
	    Currently, error messages in Eunit Surefire reports are
	    shortened just like when written to a terminal. However,
	    the space limitations that constrain terminal output do
	    not apply here, so it's more useful to include more of
	    the error message. The new depth of 100 should be enough
	    for most cases, while protecting against runaway errors.

	    Don't let eunit_surefire report back to eunit when
	    stopping</p>
          <p>
	    When eunit is terminating, a stop message is sent to all
	    listeners and eunit then waits for *one* result message
	    but previously both eunit_tty and eunit_surefire sent a
	    response on error. Don't send a result message from
	    eunit_surefire; let eunit_tty take care of all result
	    reporting, both positive and negative to avoid race
	    conditions and inconsistencies. (Thanks to Klas
	    Johansson)</p>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
        <item>
	    <p>The documentation is now possible to build in an open
	    source environment after a number of bugs are fixed and
	    some features are added in the documentation build
	    process. </p>
	    <p>- The arity calculation is updated.</p>
	    <p>- The module prefix used in the function names for
	    bif's are removed in the generated links so the links
	    will look like
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#append_element-2"
	    instead of
	    "http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#erlang:append_element-2".</p>
	    <p>- Enhanced the menu positioning in the html
	    documentation when a new page is loaded.</p>
	    <p>- A number of corrections in the generation of man
	    pages (thanks to Sergei Golovan)</p>
	    <p>- The legal notice is taken from the xml book file so
	    OTP's build process can be used for non OTP
	    applications.</p>

	    The documentation is now built with open source tools
	    (xsltproc and fop) that exists on most platforms. One
	    visible change is that the frames are removed.</p>

<section><title>Eunit 2.1</title>

    <section><title>Improvements and New Features</title>
      <list>
        <item>
	    <p>Mostly internal changes, in particular to the event
	    protocol; fixes problems with timeouts that could cause
	    eunit to hang, and makes it much easier to write new
	    reporting back-ends.</p>
	    <p>New "surefire" report backend for Maven and
	    Bamboo.</p>
	    <p>The test representation is no longer traversed twice
	    (the first pass was for enumeration only). This
	    eliminates some strange restrictions on how generators
	    can be written, but it also means that reports cannot be
	    quite as complete as before in the event of skipped
	    tests.</p>
